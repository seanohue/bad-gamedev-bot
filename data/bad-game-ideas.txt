oh i have so many good ideas.
pls hire me sega.
what about a mashup of sonic the hedgehog with dark soles?
who wants to play a multiplayer game that is adventure like skyrim rpg.
except all enemies are yourself and there is random loot?
roguelike but in outer space and you are the aliens would be okay.
i am self-taught game design!
why no game exist like x-files 1st person shooter?
why not a 2nd person shooter game?
want a game like civ 5 but instead of people it is an internet.
how about game where you are professional gamer and in the game you play games?
why not avalanche?
a salesperson that sells metal trash cans as expensive laundry hamper,
a game like tetris but where you am make burritos.
what if game had all cats and you are making meow and got to eat or die.
you are dogcatcher but you catch cats that are actually aliens and then you find out you are dog.
you are fighting war but then find out all is dream -- and it is set in pokemon land!
my fav rpg are when you have choice but then do not do choice;
why not make adventure but you are a dollar bill?
you have tiny hands and must pet all the kitties at the zoo and not get hands bitten off!
when you go on run then realize all zombies are running and you are running zombie too!?
but then bomb happens and you wake up in an rpg. toaster.
hire me now electronic arts!
please to give me job niantic?
why no nintendo job for me or for you;
like world of warcraft but everyone is ghosts and trying to be spooky
league of philosopher legends where you exist and nihilism
