Bad Gamedev Bot
===============

### How to use:
Well, right now, don't. It doesn't do much.

But if you really want to, then just install all the gems and run `ruby bin/bad-gamedev` and it will tweet something dumb automatically.

#### How do it work?
It uses the `twitter` gem and the `markymarkov` gem to learn about terrible and terribly funny game ideas, then tweet them out to the masses. Or at least, it will do that eventually. One day. Hopefully soon.
